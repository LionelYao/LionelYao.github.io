Education
======

- PhD in Mathematics, Yale University, 2023-
- BSc in Mathematics and Data Science with Honours in Mathematics, the University of Sydney, 2019-2022

Research Interest
======
- I am interested in low-dimensional geometry and topology, especially 3-manifold topology.
- Some particular interests are: foliations in 3-manifolds, left-orderability of 3-manifold groups, veering triangulations and character varieties.

Publication
