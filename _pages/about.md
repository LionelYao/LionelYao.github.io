I am a second-year PhD student in department of Mathematics in Yale University.

Education
======

- PhD in Mathematics, Yale University, 2023-
  - Advisor: Yair Minsky
- BSc in Mathematics and Data Science, the University of Sydney, 2019-2022

Research Interest
======
- I am interested in low-dimensional geometry and topology, especially 3-manifold topology.
- Some particular interests are: foliations in 3-manifolds, left-orderability of 3-manifold groups, veering triangulations and character varieties.

Publication
======
- "On the topology of character varieties of once-punctured torus bundles", with Stephan Tillmann, To appear in Algebraic and Geometric Topology

Conference
======
- "Flows and Foliations in 3-manifolds", the St. Louis Topology Conference, May 2024
- "Foliations and Diffeomorphism Groups", CIRM, Dec 2024
