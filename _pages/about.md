I am a third-year PhD student in the department of Mathematics in Yale University.

Education
======

- PhD in Mathematics, Yale University, 2023-now
  - Advisor: [Yair Minsky](https://sites.google.com/view/yair-minsky/home)
- BSc in Mathematics and Data Science, the University of Sydney, 2019-2022
  - Honours in Mathematics (first class Honours with Univ. Medal) under the supervision of [Stephan Tillmann](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/tillmann/index.html)

Research Interest
======
- I am interested in low-dimensional geometry and topology, especially 3-manifold topology.
- Some particular interests are: left-orderability and profinite completions of 3-manifold groups, character varieties and surface representations.

Publication
======
- "L2 quotient algorithm for hyperbolic 3-manifold groups", with [Tam Cheetham-West](https://sites.google.com/view/tam-cheetham-west/home), in preparation
- "[Finite covers and strict boundary slopes of cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12289)", with [Tam Cheetham-West](https://sites.google.com/view/tam-cheetham-west/home), submitted
- "[On the topology of character varieties of once-punctured torus bundles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14954)", with [Stephan Tillmann](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/tillmann/index.html), *[Algebraic & Geometric Topology 25 (2025) 5389–5437](https://msp.org/agt/2025/25-9/p05.xhtml)*
