I am a second-year PhD student in the department of Mathematics in Yale University.

Education
======

- PhD in Mathematics, Yale University, 2023-
  - Advisor: [Yair Minsky](https://sites.google.com/view/yair-minsky/home)
- BSc in Mathematics and Data Science, the University of Sydney, 2019-2022
  - Honours in Mathematics (first class Honours with Univ. Medal) under the supervision of [Stephan Tillmann](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/tillmann/index.html)

Research Interest
======
- I am interested in low-dimensional geometry and topology, especially 3-manifold topology.
- Some particular interests are: foliations in 3-manifolds, left-orderability of 3-manifold groups, veering triangulations and character varieties.

Publication
======
- "Finite covers and strict boundary slopes of cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds", with [Tam Cheetham-West](https://sites.google.com/view/tam-cheetham-west/home), in preparation
- "[On the topology of character varieties of once-punctured torus bundles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14954)", with [Stephan Tillmann](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/tillmann/index.html), to appear in *Algebraic and Geometric Topology*
